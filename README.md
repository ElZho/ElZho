This is one of the homework for my first course of ML. I choose https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/ Kaggle competition.
The difficalty in this competition was dataset without understandeble columns. Columns were called D1, D2 etc. Only some columns had real meaning to me.
I use EDA and guess some columns meaning. For prediction I use CatBoost with param selection.
